/*Data types is used to provide the space of the data 
and it also alloctae memory and identify the type of data 
variable is hold

there are three type of data type in c++

*Primary
*Drived 
*User defined

---> data type:
it is a build in datatype which can directly used 

there are some primary data type in c++

~ Integer :- in which store interger data 
             it take 4 bytes
             1 byte = 8 bits
~Character: in which we can store character 
            it is inclosed wth 'a' 
            it take 1 byte
~Boolean: it is contain True and False
~Floating point: in wich store decimal value
               it is 4 byte
               in which we can store 7 decimal places
~Double Floating Point: it is also used to store decimal 
                       it take 8 byte
~Void: null

~Wide Character: it take 2 bytes 
                 in which we store data type

~~ string : in which we can stroe the sequence of character 
           it is enclose with " "

--->Derived Data type
it is driverd from thr primary data type


there are some Derived data type in c++
Function
Array
Pointer
